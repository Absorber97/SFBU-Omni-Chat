- ðŸ“š **Document Processing**
  - PDF document processing
  - URL content extraction
  - Automatic text chunking and formatting
  - Training data generation

- ðŸ¤– **AI Model Fine-tuning**
  - OpenAI GPT model fine-tuning
  - Progress tracking
  - Model management
  - Source tracking

- ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Chat Interface**
  - Real-time AI responses
  - Conversation history
  - Multiple fine-tuned model support
  - Copy-paste functionality

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
    bash
    git clone [repo-url]
    cd sfbu-omni-chat
```


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```


5. Create required directories:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/images logs training_data
```


6. Add SFBU logo:
   - Place `SFBU.jpeg` in `assets/images/`
   - Place `Bayhawk.jpeg` in `assets/images/`

## Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```


2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:7860`
